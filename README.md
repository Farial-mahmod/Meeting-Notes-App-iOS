# Meeting Notes App iOS

## App Objective: iOS app developed using Swift to smoothly take notes in meetings and elsewhere. 
### Why Felt Necessity:
In my last job, I had to take notes on paper during the meetings. I felt that I should develop an app that makes it easy to save notes instantly without any hassle during the meetings. So, I started working on this simple-featured app. Using own app to assist myself and others feels great.

### Functionalities:
1. To add notes with title and meeting descriptions
2. To edit previously added notes/descriptions
3. To display previously added notes on Homescreen with last edit time

### Technology Used:
1. SwiftUI for the views
2. CoreData for storing data

### Tested On:
Device: iPhone 14 Plus (Simulator)
MacOS: Ventura 13.4
